<h1>Introduction: The Importance of Financial Literacy</h1>
<p>In an increasingly complex financial landscape, understanding the basics of personal finance, or financial literacy, is more important than ever. From managing debts to investing wisely, financial literacy equips you with the knowledge and skills you need to make informed decisions and achieve your financial goals.</p>

<h2>Current Landscape and Trends in 2025</h2>
<p>In 2025, financial literacy is not just about saving and budgeting. It also includes understanding financial products, digital currencies, and online investment platforms. A report from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) shows that only 34% of Americans could answer at least four out of five basic financial literacy questions correctly.</p>
