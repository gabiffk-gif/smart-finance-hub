## Advanced Alt Text Guidelines

### Including Data Points
```
When charts contain specific data, include key numbers:

✅ Good:
"Bar chart showing savings account rates: Marcus 4.5%, Ally 4.25%, Capital One 4.0%"

❌ Too generic:
"Bar chart showing savings account rates"
```

### Context-Specific Descriptions
```
Tailor alt text to article context:

For beginners article:
"Simple investment allocation pie chart showing 70% stocks, 30% bonds for new investors"

For advanced article:  
"Complex asset allocation model showing domestic equity, international equity, bonds, and alternative investments with specific percentage breakdowns"
```

### SEO-Friendly Optimization
```
Include relevant keywords naturally:

✅ Good:
"High-yield savings account comparison chart showing APY rates from top online banks"

❌ Keyword stuffing:
"Best high-yield savings account rates savings account interest rates online savings banks"
```

---

## Alt Text Length Guidelines

### Optimal Length: 100-125 characters
```
✅ Perfect length (118 characters):
"Index fund performance chart showing average 10% annual returns over 20-year period for diversified portfolio"

❌ Too long (156 characters):
"Comprehensive index fund performance comparison chart displaying average annual returns of 10% over a 20-year investment period for a diversified stock market portfolio"

❌ Too short (23 characters):

```
